            In the new Millennium, as a SCHOOL OF EXCELLENCE it has further qualified its beliefs in the philosophy of QUALITY EDUCATION.
            The Montfort Brothers of St.Gabriel seek God experience for themselves and for the people of God through their Apostolate of Love. 
            The Education Apostolate is a ministry for which they have been called and sent forth with the special charism of St.Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort following the Gospel values. 
            Their primary mission and top priority is liberating the economically, educationally and culturally less fortunate in society.
